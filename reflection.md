- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I think Inheritance is very helpful with larger programs that have different objects of a similar type. The fact that subclasses can access and use the methods in the parent class make it larger projects easier on the programmer as they don't have to rewrite those methods in each subclass. It might also help with organizing different object classes.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This program was pretty straightforward for me, I didn't have any major issues, though I definitely needed to take breaks between classes as there was a lot going on!
